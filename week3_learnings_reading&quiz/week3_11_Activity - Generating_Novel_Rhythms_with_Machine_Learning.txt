Beat Blender is a tool that plays rhythms generated by an ML model.



Central to the way the tool functions is the idea of interpolation. "Interpolation" simply means guessing unknown values that lie between known values; it’s the same idea behind connect-the-dots drawings: the data don’t provide a complete picture but you can still make a good guess to the values in between the dots.


On the left is the Position panel, which displays a white circle called the Tracker. The Tracker represents the current rhythm that the tool will play. Press the play button to hear the tool start playing a rhythm. Now, click on the Tracker and move it around the colored rectangle. As you do so, listen to how the rhythm changes. Beat Blender uses machine learning to determine the right rhythm for each point in this rectangle, even when it hasn’t been told which points correspond to which rhythms


To the right of the Position panel is the Rhythm panel. The Rhythm panel defines the rhythms at the four corners of the rectangle where the Tracker lives. Click the Edit Corners button and the interface will change. The colored rectangle will be replaced by four squares at its four corners labeled with the numbers one through four. Click on a numbered square and the Rhythm panel will display the rhythm for that square and make it available for editing. Click on the first numbered square to display the current rhythm for square one in the rhythm panel. A rhythm is a set of on/off flags at 32 discrete time steps for nine different rhythmic instruments, like snare drums and cymbals. Click some rectangles in the Rhythm panel to turn some instruments on or off at different time steps. To hear what you’ve created, click the play button. When you’ve finished editing the first rhythm, you may repeat this process for the other three rhythm squares.
