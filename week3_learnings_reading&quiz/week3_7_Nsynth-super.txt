This is a picture of hardware developed at
Google called NSynth Super.
It's an open source, experimental instrument,
which gives musicians the ability to explore
new sounds generated with the NSynth algorithm.
Using the dials, musicians can
select the source sounds they
would like to explore between,
and drag their finger across the touchscreen to navigate
new unique sounds which combine their acoustic qualities
