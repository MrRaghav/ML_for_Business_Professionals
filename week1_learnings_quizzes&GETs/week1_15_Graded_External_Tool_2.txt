Understanding Images with Google Cloud Platform

In this lab, you will experiment with pre-built models so there's no coding. First you start with the Vision API, which allows you to obtain predictions from images without having to train a model first. Then, you use AutoML Vision, which allows you to train a custom model and deploy it using only your labeled data.
What you'll learn to do

    What the Vision API is
    What tasks it can be used for
    Its advantages and limitations
    What AutoML vision is
    How AutoML is different from the Vision API
    How to use AutoML vision to train a custom vision model


------------------------------------------------------------
The vision API is an API that uses machine learning and other Google services to extract information from images.

The sorts of predictions that it can currently make include but are not limited to the following list:

    Label Detection, which is used to detect the presence of certain broad classes of objects within images

    Text Detection, which can be used to extract text from images, a process that also is referred to as OCR

    Safe Search Detection, which can be used to check if an image is safe to serve

    Landmark Detection, which can be used to detect common geographic landmarks in an image

    Logo Detection, which detects the presence and location of common corporate logos

    Web Detection, which detects topical entities such as news, events, or celebrities within the image, and find similar images on the web using the power of Google Image Search

    Object Localization, which detects the presence of multiple objects and their locations within the image
