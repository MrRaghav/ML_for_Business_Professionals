What-If Tool, a tool for inspecting machine learning models for fairness considerations. 

One of the AI Principles we discussed in the course is to “Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias,” and the What-If Tool is one tool for aiding in that. 


What-If allows you to 

- visualize inference results
- edit a datapoint and see how your model performs
- explore the effects of a single feature
- view confusion matrices
- test algorithmic fairness constraints

all without writing a single line of code.
